# Campus Event Reporting – Prototype

⚠️ IMPORTANT: The README must be written by **you** in your own words (no AI). Replace this file with your personal understanding, setup steps, and decisions.

Use this checklist while writing (delete the checklist afterward):
- Why this problem matters and the scenario in your own words.
- Key assumptions you made.
- How to run (exact commands you used on your machine).
- What works in the prototype, what doesn't yet.
- How you tested (tools/commands/data).
- What you would do next if you had more time.

See `DESIGN.md` and `REPORTS.md` for reference material (do NOT copy—they're provided as scaffolding).
