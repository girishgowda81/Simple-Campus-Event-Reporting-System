1️⃣ Approach

Objective:
Build a system to track college events, student registrations, attendance, and feedback, and generate reports on event popularity and student participation.

Assumptions & Decisions:

Each college can host multiple events.

Students can register for multiple events.

Attendance is linked to registrations.

Feedback is optional and numeric (1–5).

Event cancellations are tracked but don’t delete historical attendance or feedback.

Duplicate registrations are prevented.

Used ChatGPT to brainstorm DB schema, API design, and workflows. Some suggestions were customized for practical implementation.

Tools Used:

Database: SQLite

Language: Python

AI Tool: ChatGPT for design ideas, queries, and workflow suggestions

2️⃣ Design Document
a) Data to Track

=> Event Creation: title, date, type, college.

=> Student Registration: student_id, event_id, timestamp.

=> Attendance: registration_id, status (present/absent), timestamp.

=> Feedback: registration_id, rating (1–5), optional comment, timestamp.
